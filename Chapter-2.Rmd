# Discrete Uniform Distribution

In simple terms, the Discrete Uniform Distribution is like flipping a fair coin or rolling a fair die. Imagine you have a set of outcomes, and each outcome is equally likely to occur. This distribution represents situations where each possible outcome has the same chance of happening.

## Mathematical Definition

The Discrete Uniform Distribution is defined by two parameters: the lower bound \( a \) and the upper bound \( b \), where \( a \) represents the smallest possible outcome and \( b \) represents the largest possible outcome. The probability of each outcome between \( a \) and \( b \) is equal.

The probability mass function (PMF) of a discrete uniform distribution is given by:

\[ P(X = x) = \frac{1}{b - a + 1} \]

for \( a \leq x \leq b \), and \( P(X = x) = 0 \) otherwise.

## Social Worked Examples

### Example 1: Rolling a Fair Six-Sided Die

Imagine you're rolling a fair six-sided die. Each face of the die has an equal chance of landing face up. Let's calculate the probability of rolling each number:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect data on the outcomes of rolling the die.
2. **Calculation**: Calculate the probability of rolling each number using the formula: \( P(X = x) = \frac{1}{6} \) for \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \).
3. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results, understanding that each number has an equal chance of occurring.

### Example 2: Selecting a Random Card from a Standard Deck

Consider selecting a random card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Each card in the deck has an equal chance of being chosen.

1. **Data Collection**: Collect data on the 52 possible outcomes (cards) in the deck.
2. **Calculation**: Calculate the probability of selecting each card using the formula: \( P(X = x) = \frac{1}{52} \) for each card.
3. **Interpretation**: Understand that each card in the deck has the same probability of being selected, regardless of its value or suit.

### Example 3: Random Number Generator

Suppose you have a random number generator that generates integers between 1 and 10, inclusive, with each integer being equally likely.

1. **Data Collection**: Understand the range of possible outcomes (1 to 10).
2. **Calculation**: Calculate the probability of generating each integer using the formula: \( P(X = x) = \frac{1}{10} \) for \( x = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10 \).
3. **Interpretation**: Recognize that each integer has an equal chance of being generated by the random number generator.

## Conclusion

In this lecture note, we've introduced the concept of the Discrete Uniform Distribution, provided its mathematical definition, and explored three social worked examples to illustrate how it can be applied in various situations. This distribution is valuable in scenarios where each possible outcome has an equal chance of occurring.
